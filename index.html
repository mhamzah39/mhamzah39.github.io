        "Hi, it's Hamzah. I'm a computer engineering graduate very interested how computers handle data and how information behaves at all levels
        of the OSI model. As someone who has been ignorant of cybersecurity, I gained interest of where exploitations can occur in web applicaitons, 
        networks and operating systems. I want both free availability and automation of cybersecurity tools for businesses, hobby developers and really... anyone."
